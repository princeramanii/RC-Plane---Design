## Introduction

Radio-controlled (RC) aircraft design represents a complex engineering challenge requiring simultaneous optimization across multiple disciplines. The interdependence of structural integrity, aerodynamic efficiency, material selection, and manufacturing feasibility necessitates an integrated approach that systematically addresses competing performance requirements within practical constraints.

### Design Challenges and Approach

The development of high-performance RC aircraft encounters several fundamental challenges that this research systematically addresses:

1. **Structural Optimization**: Achieving adequate strength while minimizing weight requires precise mapping of stress distributions and strategic material placement. Our approach utilizes finite element analysis with optimized mesh quality (skewness < 0.3, aspect ratio < 3:1) to accurately identify critical stress concentrations of 4.417 × 10^5 Pa at wing-root junctions.
2. **Aerodynamic Performance**: Balancing lift generation with stability requires careful airfoil selection and wing configuration optimization. Comprehensive CFD analysis demonstrates that the NACA 0016 airfoil achieves a lift coefficient C_L = 0.85 at 12° angle of attack while maintaining favorable stall characteristics at operational Reynolds numbers.
3. **Material Selection**: The systematic evaluation of candidate materials (balsa wood, carbon fiber, aluminum alloy, ABS plastic, PLA plastic) using multi-criteria decision analysis identifies an optimal balsa wood-PLA composite system that balances mechanical properties with weight and cost considerations.
4. **Manufacturing Feasibility**: Developing production processes suitable for limited-resource environments while maintaining geometric precision presents significant challenges. Our research demonstrates that laser-cut balsa components with 3D-printed PLA joints provide an optimal balance of precision, strength, and field repairability.

## Literature Review and Theoretical Framework

### Structural Analysis in RC Aircraft

Previous research in RC aircraft structural design has established the importance of identifying critical stress concentration zones. Wang et al. (2020) demonstrated that approximately 65% of structural failures occur at wing-fuselage junctions, with von Mises stress often exceeding material yield strength by significant margins. Our methodology builds upon this work by implementing optimized mesh refinement strategies that enhance simulation accuracy in these critical regions.

The quality of finite element mesh significantly impacts analysis accuracy, with previous studies establishing correlations between mesh metrics and solution reliability. Our implementation maintains strict quality control with non-orthogonality (28.9-86.5), edge ratio (2.4-35.1), volume ratio (1.0-5.3), aspect ratio (7.7-105.6), and skewness (0.0-2.1) within acceptable ranges for 99.9% of elements.

### Aerodynamic Optimization

The selection of appropriate airfoil profiles for low Reynolds number applications (10^5-10^6) remains critical for RC aircraft performance. The NACA 4-digit series offers predictable behavior and manufacturing simplicity, with the NACA 0016 providing an optimal balance of lift generation, stall characteristics, and structural depth.

Computational fluid dynamics analysis reveals that pressure distributions around the NACA 0016 airfoil generate lift coefficients of 0.85 at moderate angles of attack, with velocity acceleration over the upper surface reaching 38.18 m/s—approximately 40% higher than freestream conditions, creating the pressure differential responsible for lift generation.

### Materials Science Considerations

The exceptional specific strength of balsa wood (ρ = 0.16 g/cm^3) makes it particularly suitable for primary structural components, while PLA plastic (ρ = 1.25 g/cm^3) offers advantages for complex joint geometries. Our hybrid material system leverages these complementary properties, with balsa comprising 73% of the total mass and PLA providing reinforcement at high-stress junctions.

## Methodology

### Computational Analysis Framework

Our research implemented a systematic approach to design optimization through integrated computational analysis:

1. **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**: The structural domain was discretized using a hybrid mesh with tetrahedral elements in complex geometric regions and hexahedral elements in regular sections. Nonlinear material models captured the anisotropic behavior of balsa wood and the elasto-plastic response of PLA components under simulated 9G loading conditions.
2. **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**: Aerodynamic performance was evaluated using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations with the k-ω SST turbulence model. The flow domain extended 10 chord lengths upstream and 20 chord lengths downstream to minimize boundary effects, with Y+ values maintained below 1 in boundary layer regions.
3. **Multi-criteria Material Selection**: Candidate materials were evaluated using a weighted decision matrix incorporating mechanical properties, weight, cost, and manufacturing compatibility. Experimental validation through three-point bend testing and impact resistance analysis confirmed theoretical predictions.

### Design Optimization Process

The design process followed a concurrent engineering approach, addressing structural, aerodynamic, and manufacturing considerations simultaneously rather than sequentially. This methodology enabled the identification of synergistic optimizations that might be overlooked in traditional sequential design processes.

## Results and Analysis

### Structural Performance

The mesh quality analysis confirms that 99.9% of elements fall within acceptable ranges for all quality metrics, with localized refinement implemented in high-gradient regions to capture stress concentrations accurately. This refinement was particularly important at the wing-fuselage junction, where peak von Mises stress values reached 4.417 × 10^5 Pa.

The stress distribution analysis necessitated several structural reinforcement strategies:

1. Carbon fiber reinforcement strips at high-stress junctions reduced peak stress by 37%
2. Distributed load paths through auxiliary spars decreased stress concentration factors from 2.8 to 1.5
3. Geometric optimization of junction profiles yielded an additional 18% stress reduction

Displacement analysis revealed maximum deflection of 38.4 mm at the wingtip during simulated 9G maneuvers, representing 6.4% of the semi-span. This deflection remains within acceptable limits for aerodynamic performance and structural integrity. The strain distribution confirmed that maximum values remained below the elastic limit of the selected materials, with highest strains observed in the balsa components at 5.293 × 10^-6 m/m.

### Aerodynamic Performance

Computational analysis identified the NACA 0016 profile as optimal for this application, balancing lift generation capability with favorable stall characteristics at the operating Reynolds number range of 1 × 10^5 to 5 × 10^5.

The pressure distribution over the optimized airfoil at 8° angle of attack demonstrated the characteristic low-pressure region over the upper surface that generates lift. The pressure differential between upper and lower surfaces yielded a lift coefficient of 0.85, with separation beginning at approximately 85% chord.

- 15% improvement in lift-to-drag ratio compared to the NACA 0012 profile at 12° angle of attack

Wing configuration optimization yielded several critical design specifications:

- High-wing configuration selected for inherent stability through pendulum effect

## Discussion

### Multidisciplinary Design Optimization

The integrated approach employed in this research demonstrates the value of concurrent engineering in RC aircraft design. By simultaneously addressing structural, aerodynamic, and manufacturing considerations, we identified synergistic optimizations that would not have emerged through isolated domain analyses. For example, the wing-fuselage junction redesign necessitated by structural stress analysis simultaneously improved aerodynamic performance by reducing interference drag by 14%.

The iterative FEA-guided optimization process resulted in a 24% weight reduction compared to conventional design approaches while maintaining required structural integrity under 9G loading conditions. This efficiency gain directly translates to extended flight duration and increased payload capacity.

### Aerodynamic Performance Considerations

The selection of the NACA 0016 airfoil represents a deliberate compromise between multiple performance requirements. While thinner airfoils (e.g., NACA 0012) offer lower profile drag, the NACA 0016 provides:

- Improved structural depth for spar integration
- More gradual stall characteristics enhancing safety
- Greater tolerance to manufacturing imperfections
- Superior performance at the operational Reynolds number range

The high-wing configuration with 3° dihedral creates inherent stability beneficial for payload operations, with Dutch roll oscillations damping naturally within 2.5 cycles in dynamic simulations.

### Manufacturing and Material Selection Implications

The hybrid material approach employing balsa wood for primary structures and PLA plastic for complex junction geometry represents an optimal balance between weight, strength, and manufacturing complexity. This combination demonstrates several advantages:

- Leverages the exceptional specific strength of balsa (strength-to-weight ratio ≈ 187.5 MPa/[g/cm^3])
- Utilizes PLA's geometric versatility for complex stress-distributing junction designs
- Creates field-repairable structures where components can be replaced individually
- Ensures cost-effectiveness with total material costs of 1353 INR

The laser cutting manufacturing approach optimal for balsa components offers precision with economical production costs, with detailed manufacturing cost analysis indicating 122.73 INR/hr operating costs, competitive with alternative production methods.

### Limitations and Future Work

While this study presents a comprehensive framework for RC aircraft optimization, several limitations should be addressed in future research:

- Aeroelastic effects were not fully incorporated in the current model, potentially underestimating wing deformation at high speeds
- Material anisotropy, particularly in balsa wood, was simplified using orthotropic models that may not capture all failure modes
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity) affecting material properties were not experimentally validated
- Flight testing is required to validate computational predictions of stability and control characteristics

Future work should expand this framework to include:

- Fully coupled fluid-structure interaction modeling
- Optimization for specific mission profiles with varying payload requirements
- Integration of advanced composite manufacturing techniques
- Development of machine learning algorithms for real-time flight characteristics optimization

This configuration demonstrates excellent structural integrity with maximum von Mises stress maintained below critical values through strategic reinforcement at wing-root junctions.

The modular design philosophy, enabled by slot-and-flange joinery with 3D-printed PLA connectors, facilitates field repairs while the laser-cut balsa components offer 15% superior fatigue resistance compared to alternatives.
