# RC-Plane---Design
For IIT DELHI Aeromodeling competetion i.e. CAIC Tech GC 
This is the design and analysis of a radio-controlled (RC) aircraft, focusing on achieving optimal performance through a multidisciplinary engineering approach. It covers structural integrity, assessed via finite element analysis (FEA) to identify stress concentrations, and aerodynamic efficiency, optimized through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using a NACA 0016 airfoil. The report emphasizes material selection, highlighting a balsa wood-PLA composite for its balance of weight and cost-effectiveness. Manufacturing considerations, such as using CNC-cut balsa components for improved fatigue resistance, and design choices related to wing configuration, center of gravity, and meshing quality are also discussed. The ultimate goal is to present a systematic methodology for building micro-UAVs that balances performance, durability, and cost.
